This repository contains the official authors implementation associated with the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering", which can be found here. We further provide the reference images used to create the error metrics reported in the paper, as well as recently created, pre-trained models.

## Environmental Setups

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rllab-snu/ArtGS.git
cd ArtGS
git submodule update --init --recursive
make build-image
```
